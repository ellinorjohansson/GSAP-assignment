### Thought behind the image:
This AI-generated image was created to serve as a product card for a digital flower shop. The image showcases a spring bouquet in a vase against a white background, providing a clean and appealing look. The main purpose of this image is to be used as a product photo on the website, but it can also be utilized in other contexts.

**Examples of potential uses for the image:**

- Product image for the online shop.
- Marketing material for social media.
- Campaigns showcasing new spring flowers in the collection.

**Description used during generation:**
"Spring bouquet with a white background designed as a product card for a digital flower shop. It should feel realistic and convey a sense of joy. The bouquet should be placed in a vase, with the entire bouquet visible in the image."
